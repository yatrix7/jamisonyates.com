					2019, Aug 7<sup>th</sup>: Thank God I Got Laid Off
				</h3>
				<section class="card-content">
					<p>
						I've been unemployed four times in my life, most recently due to a lay-off
						on July 25<sup>th</sup>. It's been almost 8 years since the last time, so I
						had forgotten what it is like to be without employment. I forgot how much it
						stings to feel like a non-contributor. It reeeeeeeally sucks to sit at home
						while the Mrs. is going off to work to put food on the table without being
						able to help. It's downright comical how quickly shame and guilt set in,
						despite knowing everything will work out in the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let me be clear: I wasn't happy at the job I was laid off from and hadn't
						been for a while. We were moving away from being a development shop to being
						a low-code, drag & drop shop with a little coding mixed in. For someone that
						fancies himself a developer and creator, that was never going to be
						intellectually or creatively satisfying.<br /><br />
						<em>
							First-world problem alert!!! Being able to concern myself with
							satisfaction beyond a paycheck is a blessing I will never stop being
							grateful for.
						</em>
						I am acutely aware of how fortunate I am.
					</p>
					<p>
						Getting the happy-happy-joy-joys from the work I do is great and all, but of
						more immediate concern was that I knew jobs were going to be lost due to the
						department's new direction, mine almost certainly among them. The tea leaves
						read something like this:<br /><br />

						<span class="blog__code-block" role="none">
							<span class="blog__addend-top" role="none">not much coding</span
							><span class="blog__plus-sign" role="none">+</span>
							<span class="blog__addend-bottom" role="none"
								>outsourcing big projects</span
							>
							<span class="blog__sum" role="none">
								paying a senior dev doesn't make sense
							</span></span
						><br />

						For the record, I agree with the decision to lay me off; it was smart
						business. Dumb business results in no business and that's not good for
						anyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, I was really unhappy at my job and that job was taken away from
						me. Was it the plan I laid out? Nope. I wanted to find a new job, give my
						boss (who is a wonderful man, btw) my notice and move on. Good plan, right?
						I thought so. As is often the case, blessings don't necessarily land on the
						big red X we marked. For me, these life-altering changes tend to go this
						way: right when I'm all ready for the zig, the zag sneaks up behind me and
						roundhouses me in the face.
					</p>
					<p>
						To make this already too-long story a little longer and put a bow on it: I
						found a job that pays a little better, allows me to spend more time with my
						family and <em>I get to code things</em>. You can kick me in the face
						anytime, zag! Bring it!
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank God I got laid off. I've really enjoyed spending 40hrs/week keeping my
						couch from floating away, but now I'm ready to get back to work. August
						12<sup>th</sup>, I get to do so!
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog__disclaimer" role="none">Disclaimer:</span> this post is
						about <em>my mindset</em> during my unemployment. I'm not judging anyone
						else in similar or worse situations. I was fortunate with the timing of my
						lay-off, getting some severance and having a wife who makes enough money to
						keep us afloat for a bit. For those that are in worse situations, I'm
						rooting for you. Keep your head up!

				<h3 class="card-section-header">2019, Aug 6<sup>th</sup>: About this Site v1</h3>
				<section class="card-content">
					<p>
						I've been wanting to do a personal website since the spring of 1903
						(approx.) and <em>finally</em> took the time to do it. I wanted to keep the
						site pretty simple out of the gate from a technical perspective
						<em>because the site is very simple </em>. I'm a big fan of avoiding
						complexity until things get complex and not before. As a result, v1 of this
						site runs no JavaScript, has no CSS pre-compilers, no frameworks, etc. The
						site is built with Html and vanilla CSS -- that's it. As this blog grows,
						complexity will be needed to manage it and I'll start thinking about JS
						frameworks, databases, etc. then. Until then, nah.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process of developing this site was pretty vanilla as well. I designed
						the site in <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, mostly because I
						wanted the reps in Sketch to get better acquainted with it. All of the SVG's
						were also made in Sketch. For this site, mocking the entire thing was
						probably a little overkill, but it was fun. I used
						<a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> to share my Sketch mock-ups with
						some friends to get early feedback. For development, I used
						<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and a
						handful of useful extensions (<em
							><a
								href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuichinukiyama.vscode-preview-server"
								>Preview on Web Server</a
							>
							was an absolute must!</em
						>). That's honestly all there was to it -- simple site, simple stack, good
						tooling.
					</p>
					<p>
						PS - if you're wondering about the color scheme, I was listening to the
						Tron: Legacy soundtrack a lot while I was designing it. Coincidence?
						Mehbe...
