This is the repository for my personal/professional site for fun and profit...there will probably be no profit, but I'm having a lot of fun!

You're welcome to use the code from the site. You may also use the design as inspiration for your own site. While anyone doing that would shock me, you're welcome to do so. Just please don't copy-paste it and and change the text and claim it as your own. The site may be nothin' special, but it's special to me. 

God bless!
