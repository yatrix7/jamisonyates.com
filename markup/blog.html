					<p>
						I've been wanting to do a personal website since the spring of 1903
						(approx.) and
						<em>finally</em> took the time to do it. I wanted to keep the site pretty
						simple out of the gate from a technical perspective
						<em>because the site is very simple </em>. I'm a big fan of avoiding
						complexity until things get complex and not before. As a result, v1 of this
						site has been built with zero JavaScript, no CSS pre-compilers, no
						frameworks, etc. The site is built with Html and vanilla CSS -- that's it.
						As this blog grows, complexity will be needed to manage it and I'll start
						thinking about JS frameworks then. Until then, nah.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process of developing this site was pretty vanilla as well. I designed
						the site in Sketch, mostly because I wanted the reps in Sketch to get better
						acquainted with it. All of the SVG's were also made in Sketch. For this
						site, mocking the entire thing was probably a little overkill, but it was
						fun. I used Zeplin to share my Sketch mock-ups with some friends to get
						early feedback. For development, I used VS Code and a handful of useful
						extensions. That's honestly all there was to it -- simple site, simple
						stack, good tooling.
					</p>
					<p>
						PS - if you're wondering about the color scheme, I was listening to the
						Tron: Legacy soundtrack a lot while I was designing it. I don't think the
						way it turned out is a coincidence.
