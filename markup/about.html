			<h1>About Yours Truly</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on and
					cheesburgers in my belly (and sometimes just for fun). I also do things that
					don't require a infernal computer machines.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been strength training (during my non-lazy weeks) since 2017 and enjoy
					it. Why, I don't know, but I do. I'm not any good at it, but it's a fun
					challenge and allows me to eat more food. Food is good. I like food.
				</p>
				<p>
					Video games have been a part of my life as far back as I can remember. Nowadays,
					I game primarily on my Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Yes, I'm a console peasant,
					but they provide all the bad-guy fragging a man could ever need. I left the PC
					arms race in 2004 and haven't looked back...much.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm also a golfer. More accurately, I'm someone that plays a game that sorta
					resembles golf on golf courses. I've shot under 80 and over 100 in the same
					year. I have a really nice Stockholm Syndrome kind of relationship with golf. I
					get my ass kicked and I'm excited to try again.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those are my hobbies and things I enjoy doing. The things that really matter are
					my marriage to the luckiest girl in the world and our two adopted, half-crazy,
					two-thirds perfect dogs. They're the reason I get up in the morning and stare at
					a computer screen half of my life. Well, them and the aforementioned
					cheeseburgers. Just don't ask me to choose. :)

				<h2>How I Became an Engineer</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a video-gamer. I have been since I was about five-years old with the Atari
					2400. While I don't get to game as much as I used to, I still find time to plug
					in and frag some bad guys.
				</p>
				<p>
					As with most life-long gamers, I ended up building my own gaming rigs in the
					late 90's and early 00's. It was that step that lead me to the conclustion that,
					'Ya know, I could do computer stuff for money.'
				</p>
				<p>
					So, I went back to college after a not-at-all successful start to my collegiate
					career, including a suspension for academic reasons and got my degree in
					Computer Information Systems. In 2006, a friend of mine gave me my start at the
					company he founded as a software engineer. The rest is history (still in the
					making).
