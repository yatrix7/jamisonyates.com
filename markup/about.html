			<h1>About Yours Truly</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on, dogs
					fed and cheesburgers in my belly (and sometimes just for fun). I also do things
					that don't require infernal computer machines. I've been strengh-training since
					2017, I've been gaming since the early 80's and golfing since the mid 90's. I
					also like reading the interwebz and occasionally the written page.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's my profession and those are my hobbies. The things that really matter are
					luckiest girl in the world, my wife, and our two adopted, half-crazy, two-thirds
					perfect dogs. Did I mention I'm bad at math? That's why I let the computer
					machines do it for me! (I'm not really bad at math, potential
					employers/clients). The Mrs. and the mutts are the reason I get up in the
					morning and stare at a computer screen half of my waking hours. Well, them and
					the aforementioned cheeseburgers. And pizza. And video games. And shiny new golf
					stuff. But, yah, mostly the wife and dogs...

				<h2>How Did I Became an Engineer?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm so glad you asked! As I mentioned up there ^, I'm a video-gamer. I have been
					since I was about five-years old with the Atari 2400. While I don't get to game
					as much as I used to, I still find time to plug in and frag some bad guys. As
					with most life-long gamers, I ended up building my own gaming rigs in the late
					90's and early 00's. It was that step that lead me to the conclusion that, 'Ya
					know, I could do computer stuff for money. And money means...<em
						>more computer stuff.</em
					>'
				</p>
				<p>
					So, I went back to college after a not-at-all successful start to my collegiate
					career which included a suspension for academic reasons. Those reasons basically
					amounted to <em>too many F's, not enough A's</em>. C'mon, I started out in
					nursing and then thought pursuing an accounting degree was a good idea.
					<em>Of course</em> I stopped going to class. God bless nurses and accountants
					(maybe not accountants), but I'm not cut out for either. So, I got my degree in
					Computer Information Systems, i.e., "Computer Stuff", from Youngstown State
					University.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a few years and enough credits to constitute an Associates Degree in 2006,
					a friend of mine and his brother gave me my first job as a software engineer at
					the company he co-founded. Befriending really smart people ftw! The rest, as
					they say, is history.
				</p>
				<p>
					PS - I did finish my Bachelors Degree while doing computer stuff for money.
