				How I Got Into Software Engineering
			</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
					I'm a video-gamer. I have been since I was about five-years old. While I don't
					get to game as much as I used to, I still find time to plug in and frag some bad
					guys.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started out as a console game with the Atari 2400, ColecoVision then the NES
					and eventually got into PC gaming. Eventually, I bought my first PC, a kick-ass
					Gateway with a 266ghz Pentium II processor running Windows 95. I was officially
					part of the PC Master Race, looking down on the console gaming peasants I once
					called kin. Ah, but alas, my elevated station among the gaming elite was
					short-lived. I fell from grace in the early 2000's and rejoined the peasants on
					consoles. I hope that history and the gaming gods judge me kindly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, PC-gaming inevitably lead to building my own gaming rigs
					<em>(it always does)</em>. At some point in building PC's for myself and for
					others it hit me: <em>I should do computer stuff for money!!!</em> So, I went to
					school for "computer stuff", i.e., a Computer Information Systems degree. The
					rest, as they say, is history. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy or perfect.
					There were challenges, a lot of self-doubt and failure, but also a lot of
					growing and a lot more success than the aforementioned failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The moral of the story is this: if you're looking for a career that you'll enjoy
					and maybe find some fulfillment in, oftentimes the best place to look is your
					passions. There's likely something there that you can settle into, enjoy and
					make money to put back into your passions.
