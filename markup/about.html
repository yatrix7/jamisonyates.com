			<h1>About Yours Truly</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a dude that writes software, but that's what I do for work (and sometimes
					fun).
				</p>
				<p>
					I have been strength training (during my non-lazy weeks) since 2017. I'm not any
					good at it, but it's a fun challenge and allows me to eat more food. Food is
					good. I like food.
				</p>
				<p>
					Video games have been a part of my life as far back as I can remember. Nowadays,
					I game primarily on my Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Yes, I'm a console peasant,
					but they provide all the bad-guy-fragging a man needs. I left the PC arms race
					in 2004 and haven't looked back...often.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm also a golfer. More accurately, I'm also someone that plays a game
					resembling golf sometimes on golf courses. I've shot in the 70's and 100's in
					the same year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those are my hobbies and things I enjoy doing. My true passion in life are my
					wife and our two adopted mutts.

				<h2>How I Became an Engineer</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a video-gamer. I have been since I was about five-years old with the Atari
					2400. While I don't get to game as much as I used to, I still find time to plug
					in and frag some bad guys.
				</p>
				<p>
					As with most life-long gamers, I ended up building my own gaming rigs in the
					late 90's and early 00's. It was that step that lead me to the conclustion that,
					'Ya know, I could do computer stuff for money.'
				</p>
				<p>
					So, I went back to college after a not-at-all successful start to my collegiate
					career, including a suspension for academic reasons and got my degree in
					Computer Information Systems. In 2006, a friend of mine gave me my start at the
					company he founded as a software engineer. The rest is history (still in the
					making).
