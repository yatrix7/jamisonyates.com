			<h2>So, What Got Me Into It</h2>
			<section>
				<p>
					I'm a video-gamer. I have been since I was about five-years old. While I don't
					get to game as much as I used to, it's still a big part of my life. I love the
					adventure, the puzzle-solving, the stories -- it's all great. I started out as a
					console game with the Atari 2400, ColecoVision, NES and eventually got into PC
					gaming.
				</p>
				<p>
					I gamed on PC when I was younger, but really started getting into it in my buddy
					Don's basement (more on him later). We played Warcraft II with his brother Dave
					(more on him as well) via modem play, Dave in his house, Don and I in his.
					Eventually, it lead to me buying my first PC, a kick-ass Gateway with a 266ghz
					Pentium II processor running Windows 95. I was officially part of the PC Master
					Race, able to look down on the peon console gamers I once called kin. An aside:
					I fell from grace in in the early 2000's and rejoined the peasants on consoles.
					I hope that history and the gaming gods judge me kindly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Long story short, I started PC-gaming, which inevitably lead to me (and every PC
					gamer ever) to building my own rigs. At some point in building PC's for myself
					and for others it hit me: <em>Why don't I do computer stuff for money!!!</em>
