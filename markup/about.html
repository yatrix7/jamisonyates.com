				<h3 class="card-section-header">The Basics</h3>

					<p>
						I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on and
						sometimes just for fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also do things that don't require a keyboard, such as strength-training,
						golf, video games (I’m a console peasant, technically no keyboard), movies
						and a little reading.
					</p>
				</section>

				<h3 class="card-section-header">What is Best in Life?</h3>
				<section class="card-content">
					<p class="about__quotation">
						To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the
						lamentations of their women!
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually, that’s what’s best for
						<span class="about__quotation" role="none">Conan the Barbarian</span>. For
						me, it’s basically the same thing, only completely different. The Mrs. and
						our mutts, Mischa and Elvis, are the reason I get up in the morning and
						stare at a computer screen half of my waking hours. Well, them and
						cheeseburgers...and pizza...and video games...and shiny new golf
						stuff...but, ya, mostly them.

				<h3 class="card-section-header">...Those Other Interests</h3>
				<section class="card-content">
					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Strength Training</h4>

					<p>
						I’ve been following
						<a href="https://startingstrength.com/">Starting Strength</a> (on and off)
						since 2017. It’s a great program that’s simple and works the entire body
						with barbell lifts. The goal with SS isn’t an 8-pack and oiling yourself up
						to stand in front of a mirror. The goal is to get stronger, i.e., healthier
						and harder to kill 💪💪💪.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’ve been wanting to get into strength training, there are great
						resources online that are easy to find via their websites or on YouTube and
						Instagram. The basics: you rotate two workouts, 3 days/week. So, week one,
						you do A-B-A, week two, B-A-B and so on. Workout A will be a squat, bench
						and rows and B will be squat, overhead press and deadlift. It’s exactly that
						easy to get started and it works *steps off of soapbox*.
					</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Video Games</h4>
					<img
						class="about__controller"
						alt="neon-outlined barbell"
						src="../assets/controller.svg"
					/>
					<p>
						One of the true loves of my life. I’ve been gaming since I was in grade
						school, starting with the Atari 2400. I’ve also stopped baddies on a
						ColecoVision, NES, Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Genesis, SNES, N64, Sega Saturn,
						PS1, Nintendo GameCube, PS2, Sega Dreamcast, OG XBox, Nintendo Wii, PS3,
						Xbox 360, XBox One, Nintendo Switch and of course a smattering of gaming
						PC’s where I obsessed over the likes of StarCraft, Duke Nukem and on and on.
						These days I stick with consoles, namely my trusty Xbox One S. I don’t game
						as much as I used to, but I still love diving into a world that’s not my own
						and disappearing for a few hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						While some folks see games as a waste of time, I’d not be a software
						developer if not for them. Gaming got me building PC’s and building PC’s got
						me thinking, “computers...but...<em>getting paid to use them!</em>”. Take
						that, mom and dad! Just kiddin' -- they bought many of the consoles I
						listed. Sadly, they stopped buying all my games when I “got a job” and
						“became an adult” and “got a wife” and stuff. Whatever.
					</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Golf</h4>
					<img
						class="about__golf-club"
						alt="neon-outlined barbell"
						src="../assets/golf-club.svg"
					/>
					<p>
						...actually, I have no idea why I like golf. Seriously, I walk away feeling
						like I got my ass handed to me, not necessarily by the people I play with
						(that happens often enough too), <em>but by the game of golf itself</em>.
						After all of that abuse, I still can’t wait to play again.
						<em>Why, Lord, why?!</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve shot 77 one week and 95 the next. My swing feels exactly the same way
						every round, but somehow one week I hit the ball like I have four
						functioning limbs and the next like I have no head *shrugs*. Having said
						that, who wants to play 18 this weekend?!
