					<p>
						I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on and
						sometimes just for fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also do things that don't require a keyboard, such as strength-training (I
						can lift as much as a 10-year old now!), golf, videogames (I’m a console
						peasant, technically no keyboard), movies and a little reading.
					</p>

				<h3 class="card-section-header">What is Best in Life?</h3>

					<p class="about__quotation">
						To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the
						lamentations of their women!
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually, that’s what’s best for
						<span class="about__quotation" role="none">Conan the Barbarian</span>. For
						me, it’s basically the same thing, only completely different. The Mrs. and
						our mutts, Mischa and Elvis, are the reason I get up in the morning and
						stare at a computer screen half of my waking hours. Well, them and
						cheeseburgers...and pizza...and video games...and shiny new golf
						stuff...but, ya, mostly them.

					<p>
						I’ve been following Starting Strength (on and off) since 2017. It’s a great
						program that’s simple and works the entire body with barbell lifts. The goal
						with SS isn’t an 8-pack and oiling yourself up to stand in front of a
						mirror. The goal is to get stronger, i.e., healthier and harder to kill
						💪💪💪.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’ve been wanting to get into strength training, there are great
						resources online that are easy to find via their websites or on YouTube and
						Instagram. The basics: you rotate two workouts, 3 days/week. So, week one,
						you do A-B-A, week two, B-A-B and so on. Workout A will be a squat, bench
						and rows and B will be squat, overhead press and deadlift. It’s exactly that
						easy to get started and it works *steps off of soapbox*.
					</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Videogames</h4>
					<img
						class="about__controller"

					<p>
						One of the true loves of my life. I’ve been gaming since I was in grade
						school, starting with the Atari 2400. I’ve also stopped baddies on a
						ColecoVision, NES, Nintendo Gameboy, Sega Genesis, SNES, N64, Sega Saturn,
						PS1, Nintendo GameCube, PS2, Sega Dreamcast, OG XBox, Nintendo Wii, PS3,
						Xbox 360, XBox One, Nintendo Switch and of course a smattering of gaming
						PC’s where I obssessed over Starcraft, Quake 2, Doom, Duke Nukem, Warcraft
						and on and on. These days I stick with consoles, namely my trusty Xbox One
						S. I don’t game as much as I used to, but I still love diving into a world
						that’s not my own and disappearing for a few hours here and there.
					</p>
					<p>
						While some folks see games as a waste of time, I’d not be a software
						developer if not for them. Gaming got me building PC’s and building PC’s got
						me thinking, “computers, only like, to get paid to use them”. Take that, mom
						and dad! J/K, they bought me a quarter of the consoles I listed. Sadly, they
						stopped buying all my games when I “got a job” and “became an adult” and
						“got a wife” and stuff. Whatever.
					</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Golf</h4>
					<img
						class="about__golf-club"
						alt="neon-outlined barbell"
						src="../assets/golf-club.svg"
					/>
					<p>
						...I have no idea why I even like golf. I get my ass kicked everytime. Not
						necessarily by the people I play with (though that happens too), but by the
						actual game of golf. Seriously, I walk away feeling like I got my ass handed
						to me and for some reason I can’t wait to play again. WHY? I’ve shot 77 one
						week and 95 the next. I feel I swing the club exactly the same way every
						round, but somehow one week I look like I have functioning limbs and the
						next I play like I have no head *shrugs*. Having said that, I can't wait to
						golf again! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
