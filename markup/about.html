			<h1>About Yours Truly</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>
					I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on (and
					sometimes just for fun). I also do things that don't require computer machines.
					I've been strengh-training since 2017, I've been gaming since the early 80's and
					golfing since the mid 90's. I also like reading the interwebz and occasionally
					the written page.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's my profession and those are my hobbies. The things that really matter are
					the luckiest girl in the world, my wife, and our two adopted, half-crazy,
					four-thirds wonderful dogs. Did I mention I'm bad at math? (I'm not really bad
					at math, potential employers/clients). The Mrs. and the mutts are the reason I
					get up in the morning and stare at a computer screen half of my waking hours.
					Well, them and cheeseburgers. And pizza. And video games. And shiny new golf
					stuff. But, moooooostly the wife and dogs...

				<h2>How Did I Become a Software Engineer?</h2>
				<p>
					I'm so glad you asked! As I mentioned up there ^, I'm a gamer. I have been since
					I was about five-years old with the Atari 2400. While I don't get to game as
					much as I used to, I still find time to plug in and frag some bad guys. As with
					most life-long gamers, I ended up building my own gaming rigs in the late 90's
					and early 00's. It was rig-building that lead to my <em>Eureka!</em> moment:
					<em
						>I could do computer stuff <strong>for money</strong>. And money
						means...<strong>more computer stuff!</strong>
					</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					So, I went back to college after a not-at-all successful start to my collegiate
					career which included a suspension for academic reasons. Those reasons being
					<em>too many F's, not enough A's</em>. C'mon, I started out in nursing and then
					thought pursuing an accounting degree was a good idea. <em>Of course</em> I
					stopped going to class. God bless nurses and accountants (maybe not accountants)
					-- I'm not cut out for either profession as I hate both needles
					<em>and</em> spreadsheets equally.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a few years and enough credits to constitute an Associates Degree in
					Computer Information Systems (Computer Stuff), I landed my first job as a
					software engineer in 2006. The rest, as they say, is history.
				</p>
				<p>
					PS - I did finish my Bachelors in Computer Stuff while doing computer stuff for
					money. It's sorta like recursion! ...but not really. &#x1F60F;
