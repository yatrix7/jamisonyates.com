					<p>
						I'm a dude that writes software. That's what I do to keep the lights on and
						sometimes just for fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also do things that don't require a keyboard, such as strength-training (I
						can lift as much as a 10-year old now!), golf, videogames (I’m a console
						peasant, technically no keyboard), movies and a little reading.

				<h3 class="card-section-header">What is Best in Life?</h3>
				<section class="card-content">
					<p class="about__quotation">
						To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the
						lamentations of their women!
					</p>
					<p>
						Actually, that’s what’s best for
						<span class="about__quotation" role="none">Conan the Barbarian</span>. For
						me, it’s basically the same thing, only completely different. The Mrs. and
						our mutts, Mischa and Elvis, are the reason I get up in the morning and
						stare at a computer screen half of my waking hours. Well, them and
						cheeseburgers...and pizza...and video games...and shiny new golf
						stuff...but, ya, mostly them.

				<h3 class="card-section-header">So About Those Other Interests</h3>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Strength Training</h4>
					<p>
						I’ve been following Starting Strength (on and off) since 2017. It’s a great
						program that’s simple and works the entire body with barbell lifts. The goal
						with SS isn’t an 8-pack and oiling yourself up to stand in front of a
						mirror. The goal is to get stronger, i.e., healthier and harder to kill
						💪💪💪.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you’ve been wanting to get into strength training, there are great
						resources online that are easy to find via their websites or on YouTube and
						Instagram. The basics: you rotate two workouts, 3 days/week. So, week one,
						you do A-B-A, week two, B-A-B and so on. A will be a squat, bench and rows
						and B will be squat, overhead press and deadlift. It’s that easy to get
						started and it works.
					</p>
					<p>*steps off of soapbox*</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Videogames</h4>
					<p>
						One of the true loves of my life. I’ve been gaming since I was in grade
						school, starting with the Atari 2400. I’ve also stopped baddies on a
						ColecoVision, NES, Nintendo Gameboy, Sega Genesis, SNES, N64, Sega Saturn,
						PS1, Nintendo GameCube, PS2, Sega Dreamcast, OG XBox, Nintendo Wii, PS3,
						Xbox 360, XBox One, Nintendo Switch and of course, a smattering of gaming
						PC’s where I obssessed over Starcraft, Quake 2, Doom, Duke Nukem, Warcraft
						and on and on. These days I stick with consoles, namely my trusty Xbox One S
						and I don’t game as much as I used to. I still love diving into a world
						that’s not my own and disappearing for a few hours here and there, though.
					</p>
					<p>
						While some folks see games as a waste of time, I’d not be a software
						developer if not for them. Gaming got me building PC’s and building PC’s got
						me thinking, “computers, only like, a career with them”. Take that, mom and
						dad! J/K, they bought me a quarter of those consoles I listed. They stopped
						buying all my games when I “got a job” and “became an adult” and “got a
						wife” and stuff. Whatever.
					</p>

					<h4 class="about__hobbies-header">Golf</h4>
					<p>
						I have no idea why I even like golf. Can someone please explain it to me? I
						get my ass kicked everytime, not by the people I play with (though that
						happens too), but by the actual game of golf. Seriously, I walk away feeling
						like I got my ass handed to me and for some reason I can’t wait to play
						again. WHY? I’ve shot 77 one week and 95 the next. I felt I swung the club
						exactly the same way, but somehow one week I was great, the next I played
						like I had no head. *shrugs*
