						<span class="company-name" role="none">OrthoBanc, LLC,</span>

					</h3>
					<h4>Lead Software Developer, Designer</h4>
					<p>
						OrthoBanc is in the credit card processing business, processing payments
						primarily for dentist and orthodontic offices. In support of this business
						model, the main projects I worked on focused on the encryption of account
						numbers and the UI portion of accepting those account numbers via user
						entry.
					</p>
					<p>
						The encryption project I completed, for which I was the sole developer, was
						done as a .Net Core NuGet package to be consumed by the company's other
						applications. The library was responsible for taking in payment account
						numbers and saving it to the onsite
						<a href="https://strongkey.com/">StrongKey</a> device via their SOAP API. A
						second stage to the project was added that wrapped the NuGet package in an
						internal RESTful WebApi service for consumption in the legacy MS Access
						applications still running many of the company's core business
						functionality.
					</p>
					<p>
						The other project I focused on, HEPM, revolved around accepting payment
						methods to be stored in our database. For HEPM, I designed and wrote the
						company's first React app to be used internally as part of a mesh
						architecture and also by integrators outside of the company that leveraged
						our ecosystem for drafting payments. Material Design was the design system
						we used for the application.
					</p>
					<aside role="note">
						The primary technologies I used were JavaScript, Html, Css, SASS, Material
						UI, React, C#, .NET Core, .NET, MSSQL, VS Code VS 2017, SSMS and MS Office
