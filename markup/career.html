						Staff Web Applications Engineer, Scrum Master
					</h4>
					<p>
						As a senior engineer and Scrum Master, I was responsible for mentoring
						junior developers, participating in architectural discussions, performing
						"lunch & learns" and running the Scrum meetings for my team. My development
						efforts were spent writing single page AngularJs and .Net applications.
					</p>
					<p>
						My development responsibilities primarily revolved around working on a sales
						and order-tracking platform built in AngularJs, .Net Web Api, Sql Server and
						TypeScript as well as a customer service platform built in Asp.Net Webforms.
					</p>
					<p>
						As Scrum Master, I ran daily stand-ups, planning, retros and grooming
						meetings and guided the team towards adherence of Scrum principles. I also
						represented my team in the end of sprint web development meetings by
						presenting on our performance to the rest of the department.

					<p>
						My run at MOSAIX Software (formerly KIT Solutions) started as a contract
						developer. I advanced to team lead and eventually Software Development
						Manager, overseeing a team of over a dozen staff and contract developers.

						In my role as manager, I oversaw the efforts of the development team while
						contributing to greenfield projects intended to be the foundation of the
						company's future. One, a one-size-fits-all SAAS solution for all grant
						management needs and the second, a platform to manage small airports and
						flight schools. The new applications were built on Asp.Net Web Api,
						AngularJs and Sql Server. Other responsibilities included interviewing and
						hiring new staff, giving performance reviews and participating in budget
						discussions.
