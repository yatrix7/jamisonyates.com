						<h4>Lead Software Developer, Designer</h4>
						<p>
							As a lead and senior developer, my responsibilities included mentoring
							junior developers, establishing departmental standards and upholding
							them on my team, performing code reviews as a senior reviewer,
							performing "lunch & learns" (I covered functional programming basics,
							ReactJs and unit testing) and helping to improve and coach Scrum
							processes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Along with maintaining legacy applications, I worked on two greenfield
							projects. The first, a NugGet library for interfacing with an on-prem
							StrongKey box that we used for encrypting payment methods. The second,
							the company's first ReactJs application which was created to store
							credit card and ACH payment in our databases to be used by other
							applications in our portfolio for recurring payments.

						<h4>Staff Web Applications Engineer, Scrum Master</h4>
						<p>
							As a senior engineer and Scrum Master, I was responsible for mentoring
							junior developers, participating in architectural discussions,
							performing "lunch & learns" and running the Scrum meetings for my teams.
							My development efforts were spent writing a mixture of single page
							AngularJs and DotNet applications.
						</p>
						<p>
							My primary development responsibilities were working on a sales platform
							to track orders of the ZOLL LifeVest and evaluations of the sales staff
							and a customer service platform to track customer issues and call data.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Scrum Master, I ran daily stand-ups, planning, retros and grooming
							meetings and guided the team towards adherence of Scrum principles. I
							also represented my team in the end of sprint web development meetings
							by presenting to the entire department.

						</h3>
						<h4>Software Development Manager, Lead Developer</h4>
						<p>
							My run at MOSAIX Software (formerly KIT Solutions) started as a contract
							developer. I advanced to team lead and eventually Software Development
							Manager, overseeing a team of staff developers and contractors. Our
							bread and butter was disease and drug prevention SAAS applications
							funded by government grants.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a software developer and lead, I was responsible for working on the
							aforementioned prevention applications and assigning tasks to other
							members of the team.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my role as manager, I oversaw the efforts of the development team and
							contributed to greenfield projects intended to be the future of the
							company, one a single solution for all grant management needs and the
							other, a platform to manage small airports and flight schools. Other
							responsibilities included interviewing and hiring new staff, performing
							performance reviews and participating in budget discussions.
