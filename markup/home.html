			<h2>Professional Stuff</h2>
			<p>
				My professional trek started out playing video games with
				friends. We spent hours playing PS1 games together and later PC
				games such as Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Warcraft II, Starcraft, etc.
				Later games, like Quake 2, Half-Life and Doom 3 lead us to start
				building gaming rigs which, long story short, lead to going to
				school for "computer stuff". While everyone I knew back in the
				early 00's thought that meant fixing printers and getting hooked
				up to AOL, it actually meant networking, COBOL and C++ courses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once I got far enough along in college with an associaes degree
				in Computer Information Systems, a friend who had started up his
				own software company gave me my first opportunity. I started an
				entry-level software engineer position in 2006 working with .Net
				1.1 and VB.Net. From there, the rest is history.
