					2019, Aug 18<sup>th</sup>: Whiteboard Coding is Bulls**t
				</h3>
				<section class="card">
					<p>
						The other day on LinkedIn, aka, Painfully Unfunny Memes Facebook, someone
						posted a question asking what programming language the readers would
						recommend for whiteboard sessions in interviews. My response: none, because
						whiteboard coding is BS. Whoa! Loosen your grip on those pearls, folks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's take a step back and review my storied history of whiteboard coding in
						interviews. I jumped out of a window once, wet myself three other times and
						have taken more hostages than I can count. Basically, I'm real bad at them.
						Despite my less-than-stellar record coding with a marker in front of gawking
						strangers, I've somehow carved out a long and fruitful career full of good
						performance reviews, leadership positions and thousands of lines of code
						delivered to production. Right now you must be thinking,
						<span class="blog__quote">
							That makes no sense! How can he code with a computer, but not a marker!
							He must be a witch!!!
						</span>
						(If you haven't detected my sarcasm, I can't help you. Also, you're very
						possibly an alien because I'm laying it on pretty thick.)
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're a true believer in the whiteboard session, I'd like you to take a
						step back and ask yourself why that is? Do your developers write all of
						their code on a whiteboard? How does one deploy to production from a
						whiteboard? I can never figure out how to get the Octopus tentacles to
						interact with the world outside of the server.
						<em>Do you use an actual octopus?!</em> Do your developers write all their
						code with several strangers watching and talking to them the entire time? Do
						your developers ever reverse a string with something other .reverse()? Ever?
						If you want to test candidates for skills unrelated to their position, why
						not go all out and see if they can juggle or throw a curve ball?
					</p>
					<p>
						The illogical nature of putting a developer completely out of their element
						to gain employment is why I've never tested anyone that way. When I was
						making hiring decisions, I gave candidates a laptop, instructions and left
						them the hell alone. <em>You know, like the job they'd be doing.</em> I
						checked in every so often to make sure they weren't stuck or already
						finished and those were the only times I interrupted them. The candidates
						had 90 minutes to complete the task and then we went over it. I'm not saying
						my method was perfect or entirely my invention, but I strongly believe it
						approximated the job more closely than the dog and pony show that is
						whiteboarding. <em>More like waterboarding, amirite?</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						You may be thinking,
						<span class="blog__quote">
							But what if I want to know if a candidate can code or think through a
							problem without all of the tools!
						</span>
						Allow me to answer that question with another question:
						<em>who the hell cares?</em> The need you have is for someone to get good
						code to production so that your users are happy. If you want to know if a
						developer can think through a problem, present them one and have them talk
						through it. If you want to know if they can code, give them an assignment,
						an editor and get out of their way,
						<em>because that's the job.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, many developers just aren't good in front of people. Some of us
						are, but only when we're rehearsed and prepared in advance and/or
						comfortable with the audience. I'm not a natural presenter and a bit of an
						introvert, so presenting complex things to people I don't know is a
						challenge. I'll never be one of the developers who do the talk circuit and
						I'm 100% cool with that.
					</p>
					<p>
						My suggestion: don't view interviews as a way to weed people out. Interviews
						are about finding a candidate that can do the job you're hiring them to.
						Almost certainly that's not performing magic tricks for strangers. If you're
						going to pay a candidate to code in front of a studio audience or write
						algorithms on paper, by all means interview them with some college ruled
						paper and a #2 pencil. If you're going to pay them to sit at a computer and
						write software in the more traditional sense, interview them that way. I
						really think you'll get a better interview out of it.

					2019, Aug 7<sup>th</sup>: Thank God I Got Laid Off
				</h3>
				<section class="card">
					<p>
						I've been unemployed four times in my life, most recently due to a lay-off
						on July 18<sup>th</sup>. It's been almost 8 years since the last time, so I
						had forgotten what it is like to be without employment. I forgot how much it
						stings to feel like a non-contributor. It reeeeeeeally sucks to sit at home
						while the Mrs. is going off to work to put food on the table without being
						able to help. It's downright comical how quickly shame and guilt set in,
						despite knowing everything will work out in the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let me be clear: I wasn't happy at the job I was laid off from and hadn't
						been for a while. The company is moving away from being a development shop
						to being a low-code, drag & drop shop with a little coding mixed in. For
						someone that fancies himself a developer and creator, that was never going
						to be intellectually or creatively satisfying.<br /><br />
						<em>
							First-world problem alert!!! Being able to concern myself with
							satisfaction beyond a paycheck is a blessing I will never stop being
							grateful for.
						</em>
						I am acutely aware of how fortunate I am.
					</p>
					<p>
						Getting the happy-happy-joy-joys from the work I do is great and all, but of
						more immediate concern was that I knew jobs were going to be lost due to the
						department's new direction, mine almost certainly among them. The tea leaves
						read something like this:<br /><br />

						<span class="blog__code-block" role="none">
							<span class="blog__addend-top" role="none">not much coding</span
							><span class="blog__plus-sign" role="none">+</span>
							<span class="blog__addend-bottom" role="none"
								>outsourcing big projects</span
							>
							<span class="blog__sum" role="none">
								paying a senior dev doesn't make sense
							</span></span
						><br />

						For the record, I agree with the decision to lay me off; it was smart
						business. Dumb business results in no business and that's not good for
						anyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the end, I was really unhappy at my job and that job was taken away from
						me. Was it the plan I laid out? Nope. I wanted to find a new job, give my
						boss (who is a wonderful man, btw) my notice and move on. Good plan, right?
						I thought so. As is often the case, blessings don't necessarily land on the
						big red X I've marked. For me, these life-altering changes tend to go this
						way: right when I'm all ready for the zig, the zag sneaks up behind me and
						roundhouses me in the face.
					</p>
					<p>
						To make this already too-long story a little longer and put a bow on it: I
						found a job that pays a little better, allows me to spend more time with my
						family and <em>I get to code things</em>. You can kick me in the face
						anytime, zag! Bring it!
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank God I got laid off. I've really enjoyed spending 40hrs/week keeping my
						couch from floating away, but now I'm ready to get back to work. August
						12<sup>th</sup>, I get to do so!
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blog__disclaimer" role="none">Disclaimer:</span> this post is
						about <em>my mindset</em> during my unemployment. I'm not judging anyone
						else in similar or worse situations. I was fortunate with the timing of my
						lay-off, getting some severance and having a wife who makes enough money to
						keep us afloat for a bit. For those that are in worse situations, I'm
						rooting for you. Keep your head up!

				<h3>2019, Aug 6<sup>th</sup>: About this Site v1</h3>
				<section class="card">
					<p>
						I've been wanting to do a personal website since the spring of 1903
						(approx.) and <em>finally</em> took the time to do it. I wanted to keep the
						site pretty simple out of the gate from a technical perspective
						<em>because the site is very simple </em>. I'm a big fan of avoiding
						complexity until things get complex and not before. As a result, v1 of this
						site runs no JavaScript, has no CSS pre-compilers, no frameworks, etc. The
						site is built with Html and vanilla CSS -- that's it. As this blog grows,
						complexity will be needed to manage it and I'll start thinking about JS
						frameworks, databases, etc. then. Until then, nah.
					</p>
					<p>
						The process of developing this site was pretty vanilla as well. I designed
						the site in <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, mostly because I
						wanted the reps in Sketch to get better acquainted with it. All of the SVG's
						were also made in Sketch. For this site, mocking the entire thing was
						probably a little overkill, but it was fun. I used
						<a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> to share my Sketch mock-ups with
						some friends to get early feedback. For development, I used
						<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and a
						handful of useful extensions (<em
							><a
								href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yuichinukiyama.vscode-preview-server"
								>Preview on Web Server</a
							>
							was an absolute must!</em
						>). That's honestly all there was to it -- simple site, simple stack, good
						tooling.
					</p>
					<p>
						PS - if you're wondering about the color scheme, I was listening to the
						Tron: Legacy soundtrack a lot while I was designing it. Coincidence?
						Mehbe...
