        <p>
          My website has become horribly out of date and rather than leave it that way, I tore
          everything out, leaving it empty and devoid of both joy and character...which makes it the
          perfect personal website for me &#129401;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possibly before I die I'll think of something fun to do with it but until then enjoy this
          banana &#127820; and even this chicken leg &#x1f357;, if you want.
        </p>
